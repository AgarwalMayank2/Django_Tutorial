# Django_Tutorial

First make a new virtual environment for a django project as it is recommended to have to separate python environments for different django projects because of different package dependencies for each project.
After this, install the django in the environment using command `pip install Django`. We can view the version of Django using the command `django-admin --version`.
Now make a Django project. For this, navigate to the folder in which you want to make the Django project and in there write the command `django-admin startproject my_project`. It will make a file `manage.py` and a folder `my_django_project` in which we will have files :- `__init__.py`, `asgi.py`, `settings.py`, `urls.py`, `wsgi.py`.
